The following must be represented in this issue:

- [ ] Feature title which includes a persona, functionality, and value.
- [ ] Populate each section below with as much detail as possible.
- [ ] Blind sizing by at least two developers if not a bug or chore.

Stories which do not meet the above Definition of Ready criteria may still be
created but must be tagged with `needs: definition` or `needs: sizing`

---

### Details

A brief description of the requested functionality from the persona or business
value perspective. This should be written free of detailed technical
implementation whenever possible.

### Requirements

* A bulleted list of details that are important to either the persona or the
  business in order for this feature to deliver value.
* Technical implementation or solution architecture, when it is specifically
  relevant to the feature, can be specified here
* For a bug, this should outline the expected behavior and actual behavior to
  define the fix required.

### How to Demo / Steps to Reproduce [choose one]

1. These steps represent acceptance criteria for the story: how to demo for
   features and steps to reproduce for bugs.
2. This should remain free of highly technical instruction when possible so
   that a non-technical user can easily follow.
3. For features, it's ideal if the how to demo is written from the perspective
   of the persona this story has been written for.
4. For bugs, these steps should reliably (if possible) reproduce the bug and
   serve as acceptance criteria when the bug is fixed.

### Development Tasks

- [ ] a checklist representing the steps necessary to implement this story
- [ ] can be more technical in nature since these are developer-facing
- [ ] no single task should take longer than one day to complete
- [ ] serves as a leading indicator to the progress made on this story
- [ ] this section can be removed for bugs and chores
